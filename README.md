# Generating-unit-distributions
We apply cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of any two continuous random variables with the same support to creatively construct a series of distributions for fitting proportional data. Traditionally, the modeling of proportional data has been limited to tools such as the beta distribution, simplex distribution, and proportional inverse Gaussian distribution.
